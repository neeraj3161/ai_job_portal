# AI Job Portal Backend (Agentic AI – Human in the Loop)

This is a **backend-first AI-powered Job Portal** designed to assist users in discovering jobs, evaluating fit using AI, and generating personalized outreach messages (LinkedIn & Email), while keeping humans fully in control.

The project is intentionally designed to be **ethical, compliant, and production-oriented**, avoiding unsafe scraping or auto-application.

## 🧠 Key Idea

Instead of automatically applying for jobs, the system:
1. Discovers jobs from public sources
2. Uses AI to evaluate job fit
3. Generates personalized outreach messages
4. Returns application links
5. Lets the user apply manually (human-in-the-loop)

This approach mirrors how **senior engineers design AI systems in real companies**.
